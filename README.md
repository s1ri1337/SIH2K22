# ABSTRACT

A real-time, multimodal solution linking disaster victims and first responders from NDRF: streamlining support to the most vulnerable.

In the event of a disaster, many people turn to social media to seek support, both material and mental. The data from these posts aids in increasing situational awareness as soon as possible. Text, images, videos, and audio extracted in real-time from these social media posts play a crucial role in identifying appropriate emergency responses to a particular disaster. Once irrelevant information is filtered out, deep-learning-based classification, object identification and natural language processing methods are used to expedite emergency response decision-making
processes. Easy-to-interpret visualizations provide details further facilitate the distribution of resources and dispatch required personnel to affected areas.
